Building [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/) using [Zig](https://ziglang.org). The project tracks the latest zig stable releases (Currently it's 0.13.0). I am also using [MzaxnaV's WIP zig port of the game](https://github.com/MzaxnaV/handmadehero_zig) as a reference for using zig when I get stuck on zig stuff. 

This project uses [zigwin32](https://github.com/marlersoft/zigwin32) for consuming Windows C APIs.
